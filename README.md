Refugee Flows Around the World
To illustrate the trajectories of refugees. Where did refugees come from and where did they go? Which countries accounts for the largest proportion of refugees. Also which countries receieve the most refugees?
I would like to enable users to choose the countries they want to see by clicking events. Moreover, by the feature of transforming animation, users could see the process of the refugees flow instead of just the static newtwork chart. I may also add the scrollytelling to make contextualize the insight.
Main data is from the UNHCR Refugee Statistics combining with countries coordinates
The properties are coordinates, number of refugees, and country name
The visualizations will be applied in this project are mapping, line chart, and scatter plot.
