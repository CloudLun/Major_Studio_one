For this visualization, I would like to know which countries’ forest areas are decreasing the most and on the other hand, increasing. The dataset is 15.1.1, Series: Forest area (thousands of hectares). There are 2,280 data points in the dataset. Instead of showing all of the observations, I would like to look at the changes during these 10 years. The main component of this visualization is the world map multi-color gradients. If the color of the country is green, it means that their forest areas are increasing, and if it is red, then it shows a decrease. On the right side, you can see the line charts representing countries’ amount of   forest area every year, and on the top, there is a filter to choose the perspective you would like to see from the map and line charts.

The second visualization draft is about showing the proportion of the population with access to clean sanitation services. The reason I chose this topic is that I would like to find out the people in which countries or counties are difficult to get sanitation services. The dataset is 6.2.1, Series: Proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services, by urban/rural. The timeline is between 2010 to 2017, and the observations of this dataset are 2375. Trying to see the proportions throughout the years, I applied the line charts to show the information. The upper section is the chart shown by countries. On the downside, I separated the countries into several line chart groups and used color variables to show the differences between rural areas and green areas.

The final visualization was talking about the question that does everyone in the world has the same accessibility to apply electricity. The dataset is 7.1.1, Series: Proportion of population with access to electricity, by urban/rural. In this visualization, I focus more on the differences between countries and also the variations between the rural and urban areas. Hence, instead of the line chart, I decided to use the lollipop chart. In this chart, you can clearly see how many percentages gap between the two areas. Moreover, at the top of the chart, there are two selection filters. One is for selecting the different years, the other is to choose which order (descending order or ascending order) you would like to see in this chart.
